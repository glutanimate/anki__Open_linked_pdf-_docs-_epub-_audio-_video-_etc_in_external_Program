- When you enter a path in Windows with backslashes make sure to quote them: When the path is `C:\my path\subfolder` you need to put `C:\\my path\\subfolder` into the config. Also have a look at the examples.
- quotes in filenames like `'` or `"` are not allowed. Then this add-on doesn't work.
- you can add additional entries to `programs_for_extensions`. Make sure to have at least "extensions" and "command". If you ever use a relative path for files with these extensions you also need "default_folder_for_relative_paths".
