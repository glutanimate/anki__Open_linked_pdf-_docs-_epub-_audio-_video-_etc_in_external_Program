This add-on converts file names (and page numbers) from separate fields in your note to a clickable hyperlink that opens this file in an application you set. 

This add-on allows you create a clickable hyperlink during reviews "my lecture notes.pdf - 123". When you click the hyperlink your pdf viewer will open the file "my lecture notes.pdf" on page 123. This add-on can only work on Windows/Mac/Linux. AnkiMobile and AnkiDroid don't support add-ons.

I have used this add-on to open pdf files in Acrobat Reader, office documents in LibreOffice Writer, epub/mobi in the calibre ebook-viewer, audio files in vlc at positions in the middle, text files in my wiki software ZIM, mindmaps in Freeplane, etc.

Caveats: Use this at your own risk. I don't have a Mac so I couldn't test it on MacOS. It might not work on MacOS. Reports and fixes for this are very welcome.

<b>Setup</b>
This add-on is not easy to setup for multiple reasons:

- Users can install software to locations they like. I can't know how you installed your software. I can't rely on default install locations because these change: The Acrobat Reader version 9 on Windows 7 32bit is probably in a different location than Acrobat Reader DC 2019 on Windows 10 64bit ...
- Creating a nice GUI is much more time consuming than creating this whole add-on. Maybe I'll do this at a later point. 
- Even if there were an easy to use GUI it wouldn't help if you don't know the command line parameters for your program. I think very few people will know that e.g. they need "page=2=OpenActions" for the Acrobat Reader ...

To used this add-on you need to do three things:

- adjust the config of this add-on with the programs you use and your file locations. By default this add-on comes with no config! You need to adjust this to your needs. Check <a href="" rel="nofollow">here for some configurations that are known to work</a>. Copy and paste and maybe adjust the examples.
- add two additional fields named "external_source" and "external_page" to your notetype.
- adust the Front Template or Back Template of your notes. The easiest solution is to also install <a href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/744725736" rel="nofollow">Additional Card Fields (Fork for 2.1)</a> and not change the install location of this add-on. Then you can put "{{info::external_file_link}}" in your Front Template or Back Template. During Reviews this will be replaced with a clickable hyperlink. If you don't want to install the other add-on there's a more complicated and more flexible manual solution, see below.

Now during note creation you can add "my lecture notes.pdf" into the field "external_source" and "123" into the field "external_page". When creating new notes I use <a href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/516643804" rel="nofollow">Frozen Fields</a> and <a href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1247884413" rel="nofollow">field history</a> to keep the contents of my source field.

<b>bugs, etc.</b>
Feedback, improvements, and error reports are welcome. It's best to post these in <a href="https://github.com/ijgnd/anki__Open_linked_pdf-_docs-_epub-_audio-_video-_etc_in_external_Program" rel="nofollow">my github repo</a> where I can respond multiple times. 

<b>other add-ons</b>
There are many discussions and some solutions for adding a file name to a field in Anki and quickly opening it in an external program. You could search <a href="https://help.ankiweb.net" rel="nofollow">the official forum</a> at help.ankiweb.net or the <a href="https://reddit.com/r/anki" rel="nofollow">anki subreddit</a>.

For editing images and sound files from your cards have a look at <a href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1560623518" rel="nofollow">OpenInExternalEditor,Rename,Duplicate for Image,Audio,Video</a>. For mind maps and diagrams maybe at <a href="https://github.com/ijgnd/anki__MindMap_Diagram__edit_external/" rel="nofollow">add mindmap or diagram and edit externally</a>. 

In 2017 glutanimate released a program to Github (but not to Ankiweb) named <a href="https://github.com/glutanimate/anki-addons-misc/blob/master/src/reviewer_file_hyperlinks/reviewer_file_hyperlinks.py" rel="nofollow"> reviewer file hyperlinks</a> that requires a companion app that is not shared on github.

For pdfs there's <a href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1442957026" rel="nofollow">Simple PDF Page Link Handler</a> by kelciour that he quickly made by request. This add-on is an extension of kelciours idea and should be more user-friendly and flexible.

<b>using it without the other add-on and customizing the link</b>

You can also a hyperlink like this into your template: <code><a href='javascript:pycmd("COMMAND");'>TEXT</a>"</code>

Replace TEXT with the text you would like to see, e.g {{text:external_source}}:{{text:external_page}}. Make sure to not use the field values directly but to strip the html with a leading "text:", see <a href='https://apps.ankiweb.net/docs/manual.html#html-stripping'>the manual</a>.

Replace COMMAND with this: "open_external_files - Separator - {{text:external_source}} - Separator - {{text:external_page}}". The Separator is a fixed string that you can't customize. I chose a string that hopefully will never be contained in a normal filename: "üöäüöä".

What you insert could look like this: <code><a href='javascript:pycmd("open_external_filesüöäüöä{{text:external_source}}üöäüöä{{text:external_page}}");'>Click here to see the external file: {{text:external_source}}</a>"</code>. Adjust the names of the fields if necessary.
